<P><b>SysEx Librarian</b> is a utility for Mac OS X, blah blah blah.  Here's what you use it for, here's who might find it useful.
<P>SysEx Librarian is FREE to download and use.
<P>The SysEx Librarian web page can be found at this URL:
<BR><a href="http://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/">http://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/</A>
<BR>Please check there for news and updates.

<P><BR><BR><font size="+1" face="helvetica"><b>How to use it</b></font>

<P>When you start up SysEx Librarian, it will automatically open a new window, blah blah blah.

<P><img src="MainWindowSmall.gif">

<P>Describe the main window here.

<P>Main area is the list of files in the library. The columns are as follows:
<br><i>Blah:</i> Stuff
<br><i>Blah:</i> More stuff
<br><i>Blah:</i> Like, even more stuff, man.

<P>Use the controls in the toolbar to play files. Choose where the data goes with the Destination popup menu.
<P>At the bottom of the Destination menu is an item named "Act as source for other programs". If you choose this, other applications will be able to take input from us. blah blah blah
<P>To record a new file, use the Record One or Record Any buttons.  Record One records just one SysEx message. Record Many will keep recording messages until you tell it to stop.
<P>SysEx Librarian listens for data from all ports on all MIDI interfaces connected to your computer.




<P><BR><BR><font size="+1" face="helvetica"><b>Preferences</b></font>

<P>The preferences window lets you change the way that SysEx Librarian does stuff. Changes in this window take effect immediately, and are automatically saved.

<BR><img src="ContentsSmall.gif" align="left">

<P>To see the contents of a SysEx file, do this.

<P>The window shows information about the event, as well as a dump of the event's data in both hexadecimal and ASCII formats.

<P>Remember that you must have a Mac OS X driver for your device; Mac OS 9 drivers will <i>not</i> work. At the time of this writing, Mac OS X drivers are available for these devices:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.midiman.com/">MIDIMAN</a> USB interfaces <font color="red">(See warning below!)</font>
<li><a href="http://www.motu.com/">Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU)</a> USB interfaces
<li><a href="http://www.edirol.com/support/drivers.html">Roland/Edirol</a> interfaces
</ul>
<P>Mac OS X also supports any USB MIDI Class-compliant device, with no special driver necessary. This list is probably not complete.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.edirol.com/products/prosheets/um880.html">Roland/Edirol UM-880</a>
<li><a href="http://www.event1.com/ezbus/ez.html">Event EZBus</A>
<li><a href="http://www.evolution.co.uk/">Evolution keyboards</a> (some older models may require a patch--see the web site)
</ul>

<P>Note: If you have a device hooked up, and the proper driver, but you don't see it in the menu, you may be running into a problem with the Classic environment. Classic tends to grab USB devices for its own exclusive use, and doesn't let programs on the native Mac OS X side get to them. Try shutting down Classic and starting SysEx Librarian again. (If SysEx Librarian is started first, and is running when Classic starts, you will not encounter this problem.)

<P>Note: The MIDIMAN drivers are seriously brain-damaged and don't work well for sending SysEx.  We try to work around the bugs, but things are still pretty unstable, and your machine may hang or SysEx Librarian may crash.  Yell at MIDIMAN and tell them to fix their driver.

<P>Note: The current MOTU driver (as of 29 December 2001) provides a source named "All Ports" for some devices. It has been reported that this source doesn't work--the interface's lights blink, but nothing is shown in MIDI Monitor. This is most likely a bug in the driver, and not MIDI Monitor's fault.
