<P><b>SysEx Librarian</b> is a utility for Mac OS X, blah blah blah.  Here's what you use it for, here's who might find it useful.
<P>SysEx Librarian is FREE to download and use.
<P>The SysEx Librarian web page can be found at this URL:
<BR><a href="http://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/">http://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/</A>
<BR>Please check there for news and updates.

<P><BR><BR><font size="+1" face="helvetica"><b>How to use it</b></font>

<P>When you start up SysEx Librarian, it will automatically open a new window, blah blah blah.

<P><img src="mainWindow.gif">

<P>Describe the main window here.

<P>At the bottom of the Source menu is an item named "Act as destination for other programs". If you choose this, other applications will be able to send their output to this MIDI Monitor window. (In the other applications, the output's name will be the same as the name of the window.) 

<P>The main part of the window is a list of sysex files. The columns are as follows:
<br><i>Time:</i> When the event was received by the computer
<br><i>Message:</i> What kind of event happened (e.g. note on, note off, controller)
<br><i>Chan:</I> What channel the event was on. (Some types of messages do not have a channel.)
<br><i>Data:</i> The specific data in the event. The format depends on the type of message. (Some messages have no data.)

<p>To display the contents of a System Exclusive (or SysEx) event, double-click it, or use the Events->Show SysEx Data menu command. (More on this later.)


<P><BR><BR><font size="+1" face="helvetica"><b>Preferences</b></font>

<P>The preferences window lets you change the way that SysEx Librarian does stuff. Changes in this window take effect immediately, and are automatically saved.

<BR><img src="sysexWindow.gif" align="left">

<P>To see the contents of a SysEx event, double-click it, or select it and use the Events->Show SysEx Data menu command.

<P>The window shows information about the event, as well as a dump of the event's data in both hexadecimal and ASCII formats. Also, you may save the event data to a file using the "Save As" button.

<P>If the Source menu is blank, then there are no MIDI devices available. Remember that you must have a Mac OS X driver for your device; Mac OS 9 drivers will <i>not</i> work. At the time of this writing, Mac OS X drivers are available for these devices:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.midiman.com/">MIDIMAN</a> USB interfaces
<li><a href="http://www.motu.com/">Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU)</a> USB interfaces
<li><a href="http://pete.yandell.com/software/">Roland/Edirol UM-1, UM-2, PC-300, S-MPU64, and possibly others</a><br>(unofficial, not created by Roland)
</ul>
<P>Mac OS X also supports any USB MIDI Class-compliant device, with no special driver necessary. This list is probably not complete.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.edirol.com/products/prosheets/um880.html">Roland/Edirol UM-880</a>
<li><a href="http://www.event1.com/ezbus/ez.html">Event EZBus</A>
<li><a href="http://www.evolution.co.uk/">Evolution keyboards</a> (some older models may require a patch--see the web site)
</ul>

<P>Note: If you have a device hooked up, and the proper driver, but you don't see it in the menu, you may be running into a problem with the Classic environment. Classic tends to grab USB devices for its own exclusive use, and doesn't let programs on the native Mac OS X side get to them. Try shutting down Classic and starting SysEx Librarian again. (If SysEx Librarian is started first, and is running when Classic starts, you will not encounter this problem.)

<P>Note: The current MOTU driver (as of 29 December 2001) provides a source named "All Ports" for some devices. It has been reported that this source doesn't work--the interface's lights blink, but nothing is shown in MIDI Monitor. This is most likely a bug in the driver, and not MIDI Monitor's fault.
